Buna, also known as Ethiopian coffee, is deeply rooted in Ethiopian culture and tradition. Itâ€™s not just a drink; itâ€™s an experience, a ritual, and a celebration. Letâ€™s explore how to make this flavorful brew:

Ingredients:
Gebena (an Ethiopian pot for brewing coffee)
6 Ceni (Ethiopian small cups)
2 cups of water
Ethiopian Coffee roasting pan (you can order online or use a regular pan)
Coffee grinder
2/3 cup of green beans (Ethiopian Yirgacheffe is commonly used)
1 tablespoon of salt
1 tablespoon of sugar
Making Buna:
Roasting the Coffee:
Wash the green coffee beans three times with water.
Roast the beans over medium heat in a clean coffee pan for about 10 minutes, continuously moving them to ensure even roasting.
When the beans turn dark golden brown, remove them from the stove.
Share the sweet aroma with everyone in the house (a customary Ethiopian gesture).
Let the roasted beans cool at room temperature.
Brewing the Coffee:
Grind the roasted coffee beans to a fine consistency.
Pour 2 cups of water into the gebena (traditional Ethiopian coffee pot).
Add the ground coffee to the gebena.
Simmer the gebena on medium heat for 10 minutes.
Turn off the gas when the coffee rises above the top of the gebena.
Place the gebena slanted to allow the grounds to settle at the bottom.
Serving the Coffee:
Arrange the ceni (small cups) on a serving board.
Pour the brewed coffee from the gebena into the ceni.
Serve to your friends and family.
Add sugar or salt to their coffee based on preference.
Enjoy your authentic Ethiopian Buna! â˜•ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¹
